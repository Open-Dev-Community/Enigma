The working software model of The Enigma used by Germans during the world war II

Enigma was a encryption device which was actually a stream cypher (means encrypts each character individually and not a block of characters) Only the alphabets were actually encrypted and was originally case-insensitive. The full working of the Enigma can be found here https://www.quora.com/How-exactly-did-the-Enigma-machine-work-How-did-the-plugboard-and-the-rotors-change-the-letters?
the software model is pretty simple compared to that because that was pure hardware with light bulbs for output. the rotors, plugboard and the reflector made it so complex that the total number of possible combinations were 158,962,555,217,826,360,000
but in this software the rotors can be reset as many number of times as required further increasing the complexity.
the Enigma worked as bith the encryption and decryption device and was finally broken by 'Christopher' the first modern computer invented by Mr.Alan Turing

This software is my homage to Mr. Alan Turing, the father of modern computer
Further information about him and the enigma can be found in his biography-'The imitaion game'-the movie and 'Alan Turing:The Enigma'-the book

Hope you all enjoy this...

Thanking you,
